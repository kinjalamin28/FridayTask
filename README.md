Create a new branch and write the codes for problems given below under that branch:

· Write the code to return the occurrence of the consecutive alphabets “aaabbcddeeee” should return a3b2c1d2e4

· Write a code to get the consecutive sub-array from the given array such that it gives the maximum value eg: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/finding-all-subsets-of-a-given-set-in-java/

Input array:- [-1,2,4,2,5,-7,3]

Expected Output:-

Sub array: [2,4,2,5] (where max value=2+4+2+5=13)

· Write a code to merge the two arrays of different length.

Example:

([1,3,5,7,9],[2,4,6,8]) should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

Push all codes from that branch and merge it with the main branch.
